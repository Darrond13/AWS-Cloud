# AWS-Cloud-Practitioner
This repository showcases a growing collection of screenshots and brief explanations demonstrating my hands-on experience across a wide range of AWS services. It includes practical examples involving compute (EC2), storage (S3), security and access management, load balancing, encryption, and moreâ€”all performed using the AWS Management Console. This resource is actively being updated as I prepare for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam and serves as a long-term showcase of my foundational knowledge and applied skills in cloud computing.
